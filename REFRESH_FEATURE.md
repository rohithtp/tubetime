# Refresh Feature - TubeTime Extension

## 🆕 New Feature: Refresh Current Video

The TubeTime extension now includes a **Refresh** button that allows users to manually reload the current video information.

## ✨ What it does

The refresh button:
- **Forces re-extraction** of video information from the current YouTube page
- **Updates the display** with the latest video title and details
- **Provides visual feedback** with a spinning animation during refresh
- **Shows notifications** to confirm success or report issues

## 🎯 Use Cases

This feature is particularly useful when:
- YouTube's dynamic content loading doesn't immediately update video info
- The extension doesn't automatically detect a new video
- Users want to manually refresh video information
- There are temporary issues with video detection

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Changes

- Enhanced content script to handle `refreshVideoInfo` action
- Added loading states and error handling

### CSS Changes
