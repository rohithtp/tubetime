# Manual Tracking Mode

## Overview
The TubeTime extension has been modified to support **manual tracking mode** where tracking only stops when the user explicitly clicks the "Stop Tracking" button.

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Automatic Inactivity Detection
- **Before**: Tracking automatically stopped after 5 minutes of user inactivity
- **After**: Inactivity detection is disabled - tracking continues regardless of user activity

### 2. Disabled Page Visibility Tracking
- **Before**: Tracking stopped when switching to other tabs or minimizing the browser
- **After**: Tracking continues even when the YouTube tab is not visible

### 3. Manual Control Only
- **Before**: Multiple automatic stopping mechanisms
- **After**: Only manual "Stop Tracking" button stops the tracking session

## Code Changes

### content.js
- `checkInactivity()` function is now disabled (commented out)
- `setupPageVisibilityTracking()` modified to not stop tracking on tab switch
- Inactivity interval check is disabled

### background.js
- `handlePageInactive()` function modified to not affect tracking state

## Benefits
1. **User Control**: Users have complete control over when tracking starts and stops
2. **No Interruptions**: Tracking won't stop unexpectedly due to inactivity or tab switching
3. **Accurate Data**: More accurate time tracking without false stops

## Usage
1. Click "Start Tracking" to begin tracking YouTube time
2. Tracking will continue regardless of:
   - User inactivity (no mouse/keyboard input)
   - Switching to other tabs
   - Minimizing the browser
   - YouTube navigation
3. Click "Stop Tracking" to manually end the tracking session

## Technical Details
- Activity tracking events are still monitored for video detection
- Page visibility changes are still tracked for activity time updates
- Only the automatic stopping mechanisms have been disabled
- All manual controls remain fully functional
